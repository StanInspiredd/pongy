# Pongy
the probably most basic and worst python pong game ever, no executable will be provided so you have to run the source code through either idle or an ide with python on it. Have fun, you can use (if you want) but it wont be good)

For some not really advanced instructions on how to run:
install python 3, comes with idle. on idle create a new file and copy the code from one of the files on this repo into your idle work space. then run it.

If you are not using I dont imagine the instructions should be too much different if any different at all. Just make sure your IDE has Python as an option/downloadble option (I'd still get python tho and just use idle for this). 

If you wanna make copies or edits to this please just make a fork, and dont directly copy the code into your repo (This is only if your using large portions of the code)

Was also partly coded in chat gpt as im still a noob.

Make sure you have pygame and sys setup to. You can find seperate tutorials for them
